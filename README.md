# Yacht Data Insights & Prediction 🚢📊

### 📌 **Project Overview**  
This project aims to analyze and predict trends in yacht sales, weather conditions, and routes to optimize maintenance schedules and sales strategies. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, it provides actionable insights to help yacht companies plan more effectively and reduce waste in maintenance operations.

### 🛠 **Tools & Technologies**
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn** 📊
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** 📈
- **XGBoost, Random Forest, Linear Regression** 🧠
- **Jupyter Notebook** 💻

### 🌱 **Eco-friendly Impact**  
This project helps companies reduce maintenance waste and improve their planning processes, leading to more sustainable business practices within the yacht industry.

### 🚀 **Outcome**  
The goal is to develop a predictive model that supports:
- **Scheduled maintenance** by predicting potential issues based on historical data.
- **Sales strategies** by forecasting trends in yacht prices, demand, and seasonality.

### 📈 **Data**
This project uses multiple datasets related to yacht sales, weather conditions, and routes. The datasets are cleaned, preprocessed, and analyzed to derive useful insights and predictions.

### 🧠 **Machine Learning Models**
- **Regression Models**: Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Regression (SVR) for predicting yacht prices or sales trends.
- **Classification Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM (optional) for categorizing yachts based on demand.
- **Optimization**: Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, and feature selection using SHAP values for interpretability.

### 📊 **Visualizations**
Key visualizations are generated to help stakeholders:
- Identify trends like price vs. size, seasonal demand, and route popularity.
- Visualize model predictions for better decision-making in sales and maintenance planning.
