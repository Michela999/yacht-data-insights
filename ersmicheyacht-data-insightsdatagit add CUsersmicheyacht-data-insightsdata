    Create .gitignore for Python Project
    
    Adding a .gitignore file to ensure that unnecessary files such as Python bytecode, virtual environments, and IDE-specific files are excluded from version control. This helps maintain a clean repository and avoid versioning unwanted files in the project.

    Add initial project README
    
    The Yacht Data Insights & Prediction project aims to leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights for companies in the yachting industry. By analyzing historical yacht sales, weather conditions, and route information, the project focuses on predicting key trends and optimizing maintenance operations to reduce costs and waste.
    
    Key features of the project include:
    
    Data Preprocessing: Handling missing data, scaling numerical values, and encoding categorical variables to make the dataset ready for modeling.
    Feature Engineering: Creating new features, such as price per meter and seasonal trends, to improve the predictive power of the model.
    Model Development: Applying regression techniques, such as Linear Regression and Random Forest, to predict yacht prices and sales trends. If relevant, classification models like Logistic Regression and SVM are used to predict demand categories (e.g., High Demand vs. Low Demand).
    Advanced Techniques: Utilizing model optimization methods, such as GridSearchCV, to fine-tune hyperparameters and improve accuracy. Additionally, advanced algorithms like XGBoost are explored for better performance.
    Real-World Insights: The models offer predictions on the best times to buy and sell yachts, seasonal demand trends, and potential savings on maintenance, making the model useful for decision-making and strategic planning.
    Tech Stack:
    
    Python: The core language used for data analysis, model training, and prediction.
    Pandas: Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
    Scikit-learn: Used for building and evaluating machine learning models.
    Matplotlib & Seaborn: Employed for data visualization and identifying patterns in the data.
    XGBoost: Used for advanced model optimization and boosting techniques.
    Project Outcome: The end result is a predictive model capable of forecasting trends, which can be used to optimize yacht sales strategies and maintenance schedules. The model's accuracy is validated through various performance metrics, and its insights are presented in a way that can directly influence business decisions.
    
    This project also has eco-friendly implications, as it helps companies better plan sales and maintenance, ultimately reducing unnecessary resource usage and promoting sustainability in the yachting industry.
